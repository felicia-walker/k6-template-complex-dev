## Installation

1. `yarn install`
2. Make sure the `load-library` module is built
3. `mkdir node_modules/load-libary`
4. `cp -r ../load-library/dist node_modules/load-library`

I know there is a more elegant way to do this with node package links, but
this should work well enough for this example.
